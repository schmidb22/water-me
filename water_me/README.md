# water_me ðŸ’§
A simple project designed to self water plants on a timer.

## What do I need?
This project requires:
* a simple DC pump
* a photoresistor
* a second resistor 

The value of the second resistor will be determined by the resistance of the photoresistor during light/dark.
This value will be different for each room, and can be found by testing resistance values with an ohmeter.
